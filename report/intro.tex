It is an unfortunate truth in mathematics that almost all problems which can be posed cannot be given closed form solutions. However, many of these problems are of paramount importance both within mathematics and for other scientific disciplines such as physics or engineering. Thus, there is a need to be able to deal with approximate solutions to the problems we can be presented with.

Ordinary Differential Equations are one of the most important classes of such problems, and find endless uses in all of the sciences \cite{odes}. Finding and developing techniques to solve such problems is a key activity for Mathematicians.

In this report, we will focus on solving second order ODEs. We will look at two different classes of problems, Initial Value Problems (IVPs) and Boundary Value Problems (BVPs) \cite{griffiths2010numerical} and develop C++ code to numerically solve these on an interval.

We will also examine how accurate these codes are, how they could potentially be improved and give some indications of their limitations.
